# [Movie Searching App](https://postersofmovies.netlify.app/)

## Project Overview -
- The movie searching app is a web-based application built using ReactJS that allows users to search for movies by typing in the movie's title. The app retrieves movie information from the OMDB API and displays it in a user-friendly format.

## Goals - 
- To create a user-friendly movie searching app that allows users to quickly find relevant movie information based on their search query
- To showcase the developer's skills in web development and API integration
- To potentially attract a large user base of movie enthusiasts who are looking for a reliable and convenient way to discover and keep track of their favorite movies
- To potentially integrate the app with other movie-related services, such as ticket booking or streaming platforms, to provide a seamless user experience for users

## Objectives - 
- To develop a functional and visually appealing user interface using ReactJS
- To integrate the OMDB API and use it to retrieve relevant movie information based on the user's search query
- To implement a search algorithm that allows for efficient and accurate retrieval of movie information

## Technologies -
- ReactJS : ReactJS is a popular front-end library that allows you to build reusable components to create a dynamic user interface. It provides state management   capabilities, which can make it easier to manage the data and state of your application.
- OMDB API : OMDB API is an open-source API that provides access to a vast amount of movie data, including movie titles, plot summaries, ratings, release dates, and more. Developers can use this API to retrieve movie information based on the user's search query and integrate it into their web-based application.
- HTML : HTML is a markup language that is used to create the structure and content of your web pages. It provides a range of elements and tags that can be used to create headings, paragraphs, lists, and other types of content.
- CSS : CSS is a stylesheet language that is used to add style and formatting to your web pages. It provides a range of properties and values that can be used to adjust the size, color, font, and layout of your content.
- Git : Git is a version control system that allows you to manage and track changes to your codebase. It helps you to collaborate with others and keep track of your project history.
- GitHub : GitHub is a web-based platform that allows you to host and manage your Git repositories. It provides a range of features, such as collaboration tools, issue tracking, and pull requests, to help you work on your project with others.
